# Cat and Dog Classifier using CNN
## I've deployed the website to classify cat and dog on: https://cat-and-dog-classifier-bymtl.streamlit.app/

## In case you can not use the website I've deployed:
<br>
For the streamlit file: 
<br>
Requires: [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), [st_annotated_text](https://github.com/tvst/st-annotated-text)
```
pip install tensorflow
pip install matplotlib
pip install streamlit
pip install st_annotated_text
```
<em>classifier_notebook.ipynb</em> requires additional [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
```
pip install numpy
pip install scikit-learn
```
Please follow the instruction in [Install Streamlit
](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/installation). Make sure the required libraries are installed in the enviroment you are using.
To run the website, run this script in terminal:
```
streamlit run st_classifier.py
```
